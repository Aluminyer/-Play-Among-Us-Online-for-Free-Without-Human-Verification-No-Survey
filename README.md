Among Us is basically a game of survival, where you either have to vote off all of the imposters and complete all the tasks, and the imposter has to kill all of the crewmates or stop them from completing the designated tasks to win. ... When someone dies, the crew gets a chance to vote and root out the imposter.

Among Us is an American science-fiction murder mystery game developed and published by Innersloth on June 15, 2018 for iOS and Android, and on August 18, 2018 for PC at Steam. The game follows a group of Crewmates who have An Impostor among them. The Impostor's goal is to Sabotage their ship and kill everyone.

Among Us was inspired by the real-life group social deduction game, Mafia, and by the science-fiction horror film The Thing.

The idea for the concept was given by Marcus Bromander, who played Mafia since he was a kid.[33]

When developing The Skeld, the ship was intended to be always in crisis and Impostors could do tasks to mix themselves with the Crewmates, however, it was discarded as they found it "stressful" and that would affect discussions

Innersloth has planned to launch Among Us for consoles, specifically PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but found a problem implementing player communication, as text or voice chat seemed to be useless.

Despite this issue, Innersloth was able to launch Among Us on Nintendo Switch on December 15, 2020, which is likely because, similarly to a phone, the Switch and Switch Lite both have touch controls in handheld mode, which can be used for typing in the chat.

MIRA HQ and Polus originally served as additional paid content for Among Us until its update on June 11, 2020, when the two maps were made permanently free for everyone.

During this period, these two maps had free weeks for all players to host temporarily.

Currently, the exclusive skins from these maps are paid additional content for the game, likely so that those who bought the bundle would not feel completely ripped off.

Among Us may have been internally named "Space Mafia" during development, as the Play Store's app package name is "com.Innersloth.spacemafia."

During its history, the game faced, and is facing, several bugs:

Several persons are automatically disconnected due to error.

Some people who become Impostors have the skills of a Crewmate and not those of An Impostor.

According to Innersloth, Among Us took six months to enter open beta and more than six months to exit from open beta.

According to Innersloth via Twitter, they settled for the Crewmate design relatively quickly.[36]

The characters' design is similar to the Morolians from Space Channel 5.

The Henry Stickmin series, which is also developed by Innersloth, is referenced many times in Among Us for significant motives.

Even though the game was made back in 2018, it only recently became popular with major new updates in 2020.
